# AnRA Lab Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centered Design
Every feature must prioritize user needs and business value over technical preferences. Features should solve real problems for users rather than showcase technology. All requirements must be expressed in user terms, not implementation details.

### II. Collaborative Simplicity
The system must maintain simplicity while enabling effective team collaboration. Avoid unnecessary complexity that doesn't directly enhance user value. When in doubt, start simple and add complexity only when proven necessary.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-driven development is mandatory for all code. Tests must be written before implementation begins. The Red-Green-Refactor cycle must be strictly followed. Every feature must have comprehensive test coverage before being considered complete.

### IV. Transparent Communication
All team activities, task statuses, and project progress must be visible to authorized team members in real-time. The system must facilitate clear communication about tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities without creating information silos.

### V. Secure by Design
Security must be integrated from the beginning, not added later. Access controls, authentication, and authorization must be implemented as core features. All data must be protected according to industry best practices.

## Development Standards

### Technology Choices
- Use free and easily implementable tools when possible to maintain cost efficiency
- Choose technologies that support rapid prototyping and iteration
- Prioritize technologies with strong community support and documentation
- Maintain a minimalist web interface that is easy to navigate

### Code Quality
- All code must follow consistent style guidelines
- Code reviews are mandatory for all changes
- Documentation must be updated alongside code changes
- Technical debt must be tracked and addressed proactively

## Workflow Requirements

### Feature Development Process
1. Every feature begins with a detailed specification focusing on user needs
2. Specifications must define clear acceptance criteria and test scenarios
3. Implementation follows only after specification is approved
4. Features must pass all tests before merging
5. Documentation updates are part of every feature implementation

### Task Management
- Tasks must be clearly defined with measurable outcomes
- Task dependencies must be explicitly identified
- Progress updates must be frequent and accurate
- Blockers must be escalated immediately

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Any amendments must be documented with clear rationale and reviewed by the team. Changes that affect existing functionality require a migration plan.

All team members are responsible for ensuring compliance with these principles. Violations must be identified and addressed during code reviews. Complexity must be justified with clear business value.
