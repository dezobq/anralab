# Research Findings: Task Management Tool

## Technical Stack Decision

### Decision: JavaScript/Node.js with React
- **Rationale**: JavaScript/Node.js provides a unified language stack that simplifies development and deployment. React offers a component-based architecture that aligns well with the requirement for a minimalist interface. The ecosystem has strong support for real-time updates (Socket.IO) and GitHub integration.
- **Alternatives considered**: Python with Flask/FastAPI, Ruby on Rails, Java Spring Boot
- **Why chosen**: Node.js has excellent support for real-time applications and integrates well with GitHub APIs. The large ecosystem of packages supports rapid prototyping with free-tier services.

## Database Choice

### Decision: PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL provides robust relational capabilities needed for the complex relationships between tasks, users, invitations, and notifications. It also supports JSON fields for flexible data storage when needed.
- **Alternatives considered**: MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite
- **Why chosen**: PostgreSQL offers the right balance of relational integrity and flexibility. It's well-supported by free hosting services like Heroku and has strong Node.js drivers.

## Authentication Solution

### Decision: OAuth 2.0 with GitHub integration
- **Rationale**: Since the tool requires GitHub integration, using GitHub OAuth provides a seamless authentication experience while ensuring security.
- **Alternatives considered**: Email/password with JWT, SAML, Firebase Auth
- **Why chosen**: GitHub OAuth eliminates the need for password management while providing a familiar authentication flow for developers.

## Notification Services

### Decision: Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for Email, WhatsApp Business API for WhatsApp
- **Rationale**: These services offer free tiers that are sufficient for a small team and have well-documented APIs.
- **Alternatives considered**: AWS SNS, Firebase Cloud Messaging, self-hosted solutions
- **Why chosen**: Twilio and SendGrid have generous free tiers and straightforward integration. WhatsApp Business API is the official way to send WhatsApp messages programmatically.

## Real-time Communication

### Decision: Socket.IO
- **Rationale**: Socket.IO provides reliable real-time communication with automatic fallbacks for different network conditions.
- **Alternatives considered**: WebSocket, Server-Sent Events, Pusher
- **Why chosen**: Socket.IO has excellent Node.js support and handles connection issues gracefully.

## Testing Framework

### Decision: Jest for backend, Cypress for frontend
- **Rationale**: Jest provides comprehensive testing capabilities for Node.js applications. Cypress offers excellent end-to-end testing for web applications.
- **Alternatives considered**: Mocha/Chai, Vitest, Playwright
- **Why chosen**: Both tools have strong community support and extensive documentation. Cypress provides reliable browser testing capabilities.

## Deployment Platform

### Decision: Heroku
- **Rationale**: Heroku offers a free tier suitable for small teams and has straightforward deployment processes.
- **Alternatives considered**: Vercel, Netlify, AWS, Google Cloud Run
- **Why chosen**: Heroku's free tier supports both the backend and PostgreSQL database, making it a cost-effective solution for the initial development phase.

## Chatbot Solution

### Decision: OpenAI GPT with custom training
- **Rationale**: OpenAI provides APIs with good free tiers and powerful natural language processing capabilities.
- **Alternatives considered**: Self-hosted models, Hugging Face, Google Dialogflow
- **Why chosen**: OpenAI's APIs are well-documented and provide the intelligence needed for an effective onboarding agent.
